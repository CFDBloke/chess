This is my first attempt at writing a chess game in Ruby.  Although I got a long way into it, the project has ultimately failed.  While basic game play is there, it's buggy and pieces can mysteriously disappear without warning before the game crashes on the next turn.  The bug is deep rooted and will be difficult to find and because I haven't followed good coding practices it will be hard to find. So rather than spend time trying to work it through, I'm going to start again and this time do things properly and not rush to get it done.

The problems with this code have arisen from the following:
 - I haven't tested the code thoroughly as I've gone along.
 - I've chopped and changed around a lot instead of just focusing on getting one method to do one thing before moving on to the next.
 - I got sloppy with my coding, ignoring Rubocop warnings and then trying to fix them all later. This just messed up my already shaky code structure up even more.
 - I didn't break the problem down into small enough chunks. So instead I ended up writing long methods and then trying to break them down later.
 - I jumped into coding too quickly without properly thinking about the problem and how it should be broken down.

 Basically, I made all the rookie errors and now I'm learning the hard way... but I'm learning :-)
